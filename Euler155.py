# An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same value C.
# The capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form sub-units, which can then be connected in series
# or in parallel with other capacitors or other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a final circuit.
#
# Using this simple procedure and up to n identical capacitors, we can make circuits having a range of different total
# capacitances. For example, using up to n=3 capacitors of 60 F each, we can obtain the following
# 7 distinct total capacitance values: 180,120,90,60,40,30,20
# If we denote by D(n) the number of distinct total capacitance values we can obtain when using up to n equal-valued
# capacitors and the simple procedure described above, we have: D(1)=1, D(2)=3, D(3)=7 ...
#
# Find D(18).




# D(2) = 1+ d(2 2) = 3

# D(3) = 7 distict values
# D(3) = D(2) + d(3 2) = 3 +
